## About

> The English language can not fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts. So lets make it simple to better express myself. Winky face.

I’m Badre-Addine, but people call me "Badre.” I’m a software engineer, and I specialize in web apps using microsoft technologies and web that just work across platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building satisfying experiences with my clients.  

My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for technologies and structure. Started building promo websites for small businesses while in university. For three years, I’ve worked for a software and computing services company in Paris, where I was able to contribute in multiple international projects with industry leaders as clients. I was in charge of implementing and launching the web app for a large European food supply provider, which as a team we were able to complete in half year. Not that learning Angular at the same time made things easy for me. Still, in the end, we were able to deliver an app that’s used by hundreds of distributors and direct customers daily and did so on-time.  

Other projects of integration, migration and even using AR (augmented reality) are part of my path as a professional. All were not easy but I'm always doing my very best to acheive things.
Right now, I’m excited to learn JS technologies like React Angular, and working towards becoming a Devops senior expert. In the following years, I also plan to explore the management side of the projects  and become a better-rounded technical lead.

## Certifications

> In order to keep the pace of today technical roles and responsabilities, being certified is a great way.

I want to turn my eagerness to learn into increasingly in-depth knowledge of my job. The more I know, the more I realise how deep and complex is IT. Those certification do not represent what I really know but still are part of my knowledge.
